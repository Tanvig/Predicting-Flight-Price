# Flight-price-prediction

# Introduction
Flight ticket prices are usually hard to guess, they vary dynamically each day or each hour. We might have often heard travellers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpredictable. Huh! Here we take on the challenge! As data scientists, we are gonna prove that given the right data anything can be predicted. Here you will be provided with prices of flight tickets for various airlines between the months of March and June of 2019 and between various cities.
